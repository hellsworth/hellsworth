## Hello There
Hi my name is Heather and I love Linux :)

I actually love lots of things away from my computer too, including but not limited to: hiking, playing classical music on my uke and guitar, boardgames (the more strategy the better), death/black metal, high fantasy books (can't get enough magic), speaking of magic.. MTG. Gosh I'm a nerd but that's ok. I also have a lovely daughter that will be raised on open source software :)

I work at Canonical, on the Ubuntu Desktop Team. My work has mostly consisted of snap maintenance of all of the GNOME snaps.
